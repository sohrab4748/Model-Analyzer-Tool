What is the Model Analyzer Tool?
The Model Analyzer Tool is a compact, user-friendly software for Windows designed to facilitate the analysis of modeling results. It provides a comprehensive suite of features tailored to thorough model evaluation.

This tool allows users to generate <a href="https://agrimetsoft.com/faq/What_is_QQ_Plot">QQ-Plots</a>, which help visualize the <a href="https://agrimetsoft.com/model_analyzer_tool">distribution of residuals</a> and detect deviations from normality. Residual Plots illustrate the relationship between predicted values and residuals, aiding in assessing model accuracy. <a href="https://agrimetsoft.com/faq/What_is_Confidence_Bound_in_Modeling">Confidence and Prediction Bounds</a> offer insights into the likely range of true values. Efficiency indices, such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and the Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency Coefficient (NSE), are automatically computed to quantify model performance.

Additionally, the tool analyzes autocorrelation in model residuals to identify any remaining patterns or dependencies that the model may have missed.

In summary, the Model Analyzer Tool is an invaluable asset for analyzing and evaluating modeling results. Its intuitive interface, detailed plots, and automated efficiency index calculations make it an all-encompassing and effective tool for model analysis.
